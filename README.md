# Calixy

**Calixy** is a mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and React Native. Its goal is to support users in maintaining a healthy lifestyle by helping them:

- Log meals and track daily calorie intake  
- Record workouts and physical activity  
- View daily, weekly, and monthly statistics  

## Project Status

This project is currently under active development. I'm working on the core features and app structure. The code is regularly updated as the development progresses.

## Technologies

- React Native  
- Expo  
- TypeScript (planned)  
- Local Storage / SQLite (planned)  

## Why this project?

Iâ€™m building Calixy to improve my skills as a mobile developer while creating a useful tool for real-life health tracking. This project allows me to work on state management, mobile navigation, UI/UX design, and offline data handling.
